# TutionBuddy Multi-Agent Implementation Preview

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Optimal Architecture: Crew AI + LangGraph**

Based on your requirements, here's exactly how the enhanced system would work:

---

## **Example 1: Math Question Flow**

### **Current System:**
```
Student asks: "Shopkeeper bought car for â‚¹1,50,000..."
â†“
Single AI processes everything
â†“
Generic response
```

### **Enhanced Multi-Agent System:**
```
Student asks math question
â†“
LangGraph: Analyze question type = "profit/loss calculation"
â†“ 
Crew AI: Route to Math Specialist Agent
â†“
Math Agent: "I need document context for this problem"
â†“
MCP Tool: Retrieve relevant lesson content
â†“
Math Agent: Generate step-by-step solution with Indian number formatting
â†“
LangGraph: Check if student understood (assessment workflow)
â†“
If not understood â†’ Hint Assistant Agent provides progressive clues
â†“
If understood â†’ Quiz Master Agent suggests practice problems
```

---

## **Example 2: Homework Assistance Flow**

### **Enhanced Workflow with LangGraph:**
```python
# Smart homework workflow with branching logic
def homework_workflow():
    if student_attempts < 3:
        return hint_assistant.gentle_nudge()
    elif student_attempts < 5:
        return hint_assistant.conceptual_guidance()
    elif understanding_score < 0.5:
        return teacher_agent.reteach_concept()
    else:
        return math_specialist.step_by_step_solution()
```

### **Result:**
- **Smart Escalation**: System knows when to provide more help
- **Role Clarity**: Each agent has specific expertise
- **Learning Focus**: Never gives direct answers, always guides learning

## **Code Preview: Actual Implementation**

### **1. Agent Definitions**
```python
# agents/math_specialist.py
from crewai import Agent
from tools.indian_number_formatter import IndianNumberTool
from tools.step_solver import StepSolverTool

math_specialist = Agent(
    role="Mathematics Teacher",
    goal="Provide step-by-step math solutions using Indian number system",
    backstory="""Expert in CBSE 5th grade mathematics with deep understanding 
    of Indian currency, measurements, and problem-solving approaches.""",
    tools=[
        IndianNumberTool(),
        StepSolverTool(), 
        DocumentRetrieverTool()
    ],
    verbose=True
)
```

### **2. LangGraph Workflow**
```python
# workflows/math_learning_flow.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

def create_math_workflow():
    workflow = StateGraph(MathState)
    
    # Add decision nodes
    workflow.add_node("analyze_problem", analyze_math_problem)
    workflow.add_node("check_understanding", assess_student_comprehension)
    workflow.add_node("provide_hint", generate_progressive_hint)
    workflow.add_node("solve_step", provide_step_solution)
    workflow.add_node("generate_practice", create_similar_problems)
    
    # Smart routing based on student performance
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "check_understanding",
        route_based_on_performance,
        {
            "understood": "generate_practice",      # Success path
            "partial": "provide_hint",              # Need gentle help
            "confused": "solve_step",               # Need detailed help
            "stuck": "analyze_problem"              # Start over with simpler approach
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

### **3. Enhanced Flask Route**
```python
# Enhanced homework assistance endpoint
@app.route('/api/homework-enhanced', methods=['POST'])
def homework_enhanced():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Initialize multi-agent crew
    homework_crew = Crew(
        agents=[
            math_specialist,      # For math problems
            hint_assistant,       # For progressive hints
            teacher_agent,        # For general teaching
            quiz_master          # For practice generation
        ],
        process=Process.hierarchical,  # Teacher leads, others support
        manager_llm=ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-pro")
    )
    
    # Run LangGraph workflow
    math_workflow = create_math_workflow()
    
    result = math_workflow.invoke({
        "question": data['question'],
        "subject": "mathematics",
        "document_context": get_document_context(data['document_id']),
        "student_attempt_count": data.get('attempts', 0),
        "previous_hints": data.get('hints_used', [])
    })
    
    return jsonify({
        "agent_response": result['answer'],
        "responsible_agent": result['agent_name'],
        "next_hint_available": result['has_more_hints'],
        "practice_problems": result.get('practice_suggestions', []),
        "audio_url": result['audio_url']
    })
```

## **Real Scenarios: Before vs After**

### **Scenario 1: Student Struggling with Fractions**

**Before (Single AI):**
- Gives complete solution immediately
- Student doesn't learn the process
- No adaptive difficulty

**After (Multi-Agent + LangGraph):**
```
Attempt 1: Hint Assistant â†’ "Think about what fraction means"
Attempt 2: Hint Assistant â†’ "Try drawing the fraction as parts of a whole"
Attempt 3: Math Specialist â†’ "Let me show you one step: 1/2 = ?"
Attempt 4: Teacher Agent â†’ "Let's start with easier fractions first"
Success: Quiz Master â†’ "Great! Try these similar problems"
```

### **Scenario 2: Hindi Literature Question**

**Before:**
- Generic AI tries to handle Hindi content
- May lack cultural context
- No specialized knowledge

**After:**
```
Question in Hindi detected
â†“
LangGraph routes to Hindi Specialist Agent
â†“
Agent responds in appropriate Hindi/English mix
â†“
Cultural context and literary analysis provided
â†“
Suggest related poems/stories for practice
```

## **Key Advantages of This Architecture**

### **1. Intelligent Routing**
```python
def route_question_intelligently(question, subject, difficulty):
    if "profit" in question and "loss" in question:
        return math_specialist  # Math word problems
    elif "poem" in question or "kavita" in question:
        return hindi_specialist  # Literature analysis
    elif difficulty > 0.8:
        return teacher_agent    # Complex concepts need main teacher
    else:
        return quiz_master      # Simple questions for quick practice
```

### **2. Progressive Learning**
```python
# LangGraph automatically manages learning progression
if student_success_rate > 0.8:
    difficulty_level += 1  # Make questions harder
    unlock_next_chapter()
elif student_success_rate < 0.3:
    difficulty_level -= 1  # Provide more foundational practice
    recommend_revision()
```

### **3. Collaborative Intelligence**
```python
# Multiple agents work together on complex problems
complex_math_problem = {
    "primary": math_specialist,           # Solves the math
    "support": [
        hint_assistant,                   # Provides progressive clues
        teacher_agent,                    # Explains concepts
        voice_assistant                   # Reads solution aloud
    ]
}
```

## **Migration Strategy: Minimal Risk**

### **Phase 1: Run in Parallel**
- Keep existing system as default
- Add feature flag: `USE_MULTI_AGENT=false`
- Test new system with 10% of traffic

### **Phase 2: A/B Testing**
- Compare performance metrics:
  - Student engagement time
  - Problem-solving success rate
  - Hint effectiveness
  - Overall satisfaction

### **Phase 3: Gradual Rollout**
- Subject by subject migration
- Start with Mathematics (clear success metrics)
- Monitor and optimize

### **Phase 4: Full Migration**
- Switch default to multi-agent system
- Keep legacy as fallback
- Complete feature parity
